In order to run a human player vs computer type of scenario, run the file called run_connect_5.py.

The program will display several sections of information:

1. The game board

2. A coordinate diagram to be used as a reference for selecting
	the appropriate coordinates in order to make a move

3. A prompt asking for user input in the form of two comma delimited
	coordinates for the row and column (or the values as shown in 
	the second section)

	
RULES:

The players will take turns playing pieces onto the board. The player will
make the first move. Following this, the computer will take time to formulate
it's next move. When the screen displays the coordinate diagram described in section
2 and the prompt for the next move, the player may input their selection. When either
the AI or the player creates a row, column, or diagonal of length 5, the game will be
over and the program will exit.
